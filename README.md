- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucasrorah
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how the bitcoin works and becoming a part of the community building it. I am hoping to soon get a job at a bitcoin focust company.
- 🌱 I’m currently working through Programming Bitcoin by Jimmy Song and setting up my full node. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can but I don't have any coding experience so I'm not sure I would be much help. 
- 📫 How to reach me: lucaswrorah@gmail.com
